    <h1>
      Hello! Cześć! Hola! Ciao!
    </h1>

    <p>
      I'm Riccardo, but you can call me Rick. <br/>
      Or Rysiek if you want to work on your Polish pronunciation.
    </p>

    <p>
      I'm a rising star software engineer at <a href="http://www.lunarlogic.io/" target="_blank">Lunar Logic</a>. <br/>
    </p>

    <p>
      Currently I work with Ruby and JavaScript. <br/>
      But those two are just excuses to broaden my horizons. This is why, for example, this last week (today is 1469910177) I have been busy with DDD, CQRS, YEAH and FRP. <br/>
      I suck at all of them but I'm excited whenever I can deep dive into software architecture and improve my coding skills. <br/>
      Also, sometimes I wear the devops hat and break some stuff around too. That's fun. <br/>
    </p>

    <p>
      By the way, have you really googled for YEAH?!1?1? I bet they have come up with YEAH.js and ruined my joke though. <br/>
    </p>

    <p>
      This web page is responsive, super fast and, most importantly, good enough.
      In fact, I've decided to focus on what matters most: being awesome. <br/>
      This means in this specific moment I'm either geeking up or out doing something cool. <br/>
      This also means that it's really difficult to get in contact with me.
      But if you are a good hacker I bet you will manage.
    </p>

      Hopefully I'll meet you somewhere in the community soon. I'm sure we will come up with something great altogether. <br/>
      Or we will just get drunk and have a nostalgic chat on those shitty web pages from the eighties with no CSS and JS.
