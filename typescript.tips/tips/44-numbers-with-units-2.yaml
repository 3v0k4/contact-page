title: Numbers with units (2)
description: You can brand types to distinguish one from the other. Though, if you need to prevent combining types, branding is not a good solution.
badCode: |
  const height: number = 2
  const weight: number = 3

  const format = (height: number, weight: number): string => ""

  format(weight, height) // ⛔️ Swapped
goodCode: |
  declare const brand: unique symbol;
  type Brand<Type, Brand> = Type & { readonly [brand]: Brand }

  type Height = Brand<number, "Height">
  type Weight = Brand<number, "Weight">

  const height = 2 as Height
  const weight = 3 as Weight

  const format = (height: Height, weight: Weight): string => ""

  format(weight, height) // ✅ Does not compile
  weight + height // ⛔️ Do not use branding if need combining
