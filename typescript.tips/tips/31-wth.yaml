title: WTH?!
description: From time to time, I get stuck into the following error. With this tip, I'm making sure the next time I google for it, I'll see my own explanation.
goodCode: |
  const identityBool = <T extends boolean>(x: T = false): T => x // ⛔️
  // Type 'boolean' is not assignable to type 'T'.
  //   'boolean' is assignable to the constraint of type 'T',
  //    but 'T' could be instantiated with a different subtype
  //    of constraint 'boolean'.

  const identityTrue: <T extends true>(x: T) => T = identityBool
  // This is what the error above refers to.
