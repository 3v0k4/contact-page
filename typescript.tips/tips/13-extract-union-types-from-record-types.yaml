description: Let the compiler keep in sync your types, so you don't have to remember it yourself.
badCode: |
  type Admin = { _kind: 'admin' }
  type Member = { _kind: 'member' }
  type Visitor = { _kind: 'visitor' }

  type Roles = 'admin' | 'member' // ⛔️ Forgot 'visitor'
goodCode: |
  type User = Admin | Member | Visitor

  type Roles = User['_kind']
  //   ^? type Roles = 'admin' | 'member' | 'visitor'
