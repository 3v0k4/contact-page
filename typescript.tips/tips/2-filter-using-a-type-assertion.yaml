title: Filter using a type assertion
description: When you filter an array of union types, make sure it gets reflected in the type.
badCode: |
  type Admin = { _kind: 'admin', adminId: number }
  type Member = { _kind: 'member', userId: number }
  type User = Admin | Member

  const onlyAdmins = users.filter(x => x._kind === 'admin')
  //    ^? const onlyAdmins: User[]
  //    ⛔️ Should be Admin[]
goodCode: |
  const isAdmin = (user: User): user is Admin =>
    user._kind === 'admin'
  const onlyAdmins = users.filter(isAdmin)
  //    ^? const onlyAdmins: Admin[] ✅
