badCode: |
  type PostCode = string | number

  const shipTo = (postCode: PostCode) => {
    if (typeof postCode === "string") {
      // format string
    } else { // ⛔️ Need to branch
      // format number
    }

  type PostCode = string

  const shipTo = (postCode: PostCode) => {
    // ✅ Only need to format string
  }
