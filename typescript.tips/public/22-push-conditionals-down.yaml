title: Push conditionals down
description: If you lean on static types and push conditionals down, you may be able to avoid testing glue code with integration tests.
badCode: |
  const go = () => {
    const x = doA()
    return is(x) ? doB(x) : doC(x)
  }
  // ⛔️ Need two integration tests due to the conditional
  // ⛔️ If two conditionals are added, need eight tests
goodCode: |
  const go = () => {
    const x = doA()
    doBOrC(x)
  }
  // ✅ Need two unit tests in doBOrC()
  // ✅ If two conditionals are added,
  //    doBOrC() still needs two unit tests.
