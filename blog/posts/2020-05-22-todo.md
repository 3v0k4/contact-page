Websites are supposed to implement a page for broken or dead links. The content of this post is in that page. That includes my apologies.

<div class="accordion">
<input type="checkbox" name="accordion" id="handle" />
<label class="accordion-label" for="handle">Hint</label>
<div class="accordion-content">Trigger a 404 error by visiting a non-existing link on my website. Make it fun by leaving a message in the URL. I promise I'll go and check the logs from time to time!</div>
</div>

Don't want to solve the riddle? Here's the link to ["It's Called Mistake, Not Bug"](/404.html?lazy)

The first person I’ve heard calling out bug vs mistake was Rainsberger. Thank you Rainsberger! Plus, I’ve been reading Blackbox Thinking in the last few days and it does a great job at explaining how cognitive dissonance works and why we need dissonance reducing strategies like calling a mistake a bug.
