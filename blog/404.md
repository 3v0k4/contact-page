I am sorry.

If you got here by clicking on a link and you are not an internet bot, then I made a mistake.

I could call it a bug to protect my professional self worth. But I want to take ownership instead. Blaming an insect roaming around the codebase is unprofessional: it's my job to put the most care in my craft.

Using the b-word doesn't build trust. Taking responsibility, asking for forgiveness and doing better does.

I make mistakes all the time. However, I hope you will be so kind to let me know when I do. I want to hone my skills and your contribution is paramount.
