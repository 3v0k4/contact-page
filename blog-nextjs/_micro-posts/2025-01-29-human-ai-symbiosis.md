- Start with your idea and use AI on top
- Don't replace people or you lose wisdom: purpose, mission, culture
- A chess game with AI vs AI+Human would see the latter win 10x
- Automating with AI means you now have the time for the things you keep postponing (and not less work to do)
- How to develop creativity? Make people work on problems that can only be solved by being creative
- You need to know the domain to prompt properly an LLM
