The AI took me too literally ðŸ˜…

<img width="750" alt="Screenshot: Why this is dumb: 1. No error handling - If sudo fails, the script just continues. 2. Blindly appends the line - Doesn't check if /etc/hosts is writable. 3. Relies on sudo inside system - Instead of checking permissions, it just assumes the user has sudo access and will enter a password. 4. Potential security issue - If someone modifies the script, it could be abused for other sudo commands. It gets the job done with minimal thought! 4" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d89b6fce-3e6e-449b-9724-755f5c3e14a7" />
