Will Guidara hires Dreamweavers in his restaurant.

Their job is to *pull legends*: creating, automating, and scaling unforgettable experiences.

From Will Guidara’s Unreasonable Hospitality: 

> I told the story in pre-meal, and the term “Legend” became shorthand within the restaurant for these special touches—as in, “I did the best Legend for a table last night.” The name took on even greater significance as we realized what made these Legends so legendary. **Namely, they gave people a story—a Legend—to tell.** Why do people put so much time and effort into a marriage proposal? Because they know it’s a story they’ll tell for the rest of their lives. The best of those stories do two things: First, they put you right back in the moment, so that you’re not just recounting the experience, but reliving it. Second, the story itself tells you that while you were having the experience, you were seen and heard.
>
> These days, people, especially younger people, are more interested in collecting experiences than in getting more stuff. But restaurant meals, like many service experiences, are ephemeral. You can take a copy of the menu home, and pictures of your plate, but you can’t relive that bite of foie gras.
>
> That changes when you leave with a story that’s good enough to put you back in the moment, as if you were living it all over again. That’s why we took the Legends so seriously. **If people were coming to us to add to their collection of experiences, then we saw these not as extra flourishes but as a responsibility: to give people a memory so good it enabled them to relive their experience with us.** The true gift, then, wasn’t the street hot dog or the bag full of candy bars; it was the story that made a Legend a legend.
