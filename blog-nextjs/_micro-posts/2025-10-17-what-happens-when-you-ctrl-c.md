When yout Ctrl-C in the terminal, SIGINT is sent to all the processes that belong to the foreground process group id (TPGID). (The same is true for any signals generated by the keyboard: SIGTSTP, SIGINT, etc.)

To find the TPGID, you can `ps -O tpgid`. For example, if I run `ser bin/dev` in a Rails app ([ser](https://github.com/3v0k4/ser) is a local reverse-proxy I wrote):

```bash
  PID TPGID   TT  STAT      TIME COMMAND
 1444  2822 s000  S      0:00.90 -zsh
 2822  2822 s000  S+     0:01.68 /Users/riccardoodone/.rvm/gems/ruby-3.4.4/gems/ser-0.1.0-x86_64-darwin/exe/x86_64-darwin/ser bin/dev
 3484  2822 s000  S+     0:00.64 foreman: main
 3509  2822 s000  S+     0:06.32 puma 7.0.4 (tcp://localhost:3000) [rictionary]
 3510  2822 s000  S+     0:12.17 sidekiq 8.0.8 rictionary [0 of 7 busy]
 3535  2822 s000  S+     0:00.10 puma: cluster worker 0: 3509 [rictionary]
 3536  2822 s000  S+     0:00.10 puma: cluster worker 1: 3509 [rictionary]
 3537  2822 s000  S+     0:00.11 puma: cluster worker 2: 3509 [rictionary]
 3538  2822 s000  S+     0:00.10 puma: cluster worker 3: 3509 [rictionary]
 3539  2822 s000  S+     0:00.10 puma: cluster worker 4: 3509 [rictionary]
 3540  2822 s000  S+     0:00.10 puma: cluster worker 5: 3509 [rictionary]
```

If you wanted to simulate a Ctrl-C programmatically, you could send a signal to the `-TPGID` (minus means process group):

```bash
kill -INT -2822
```
