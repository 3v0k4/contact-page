When trying to understand demand (for sales, marketing, or product), organize notes in the following categories:
- Misc
- Pains
  - That you may address/solve
- Worldview (e.g., Android is freedom vs iOS just works)
  - Segment base on this not demographicsâ€”why should race or age matter?
- Jargon
  - Useful to write copy
- Recommendations
  - Alternatives solutions people use
