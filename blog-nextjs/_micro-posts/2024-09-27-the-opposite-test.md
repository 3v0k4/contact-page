When "positioning" something, if the opposite of what you claim is bullshit, what you claim is bullshit.

If you've ever heard any of the following statements:
- Our company is customer-first
- Our product is fast & easy-to-use

Ask yourself:
- Would any company pick customer-last as a strategy?
- Would any product go for slow & hard-to-use?

Nope. Because that's bullshit!
