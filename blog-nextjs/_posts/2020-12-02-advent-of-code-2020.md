The [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) has started!

It's a tradition of mine to use a different language each year. In 2018 I went with PureScript, in 2019 I switched to Haskell, and this year I'm trying Rust.

I'll give up earlier than usual because I don't know enough of the language to do real damages. Still, I'm already having a ton of fun.

The best part is learning together by coding in public:
