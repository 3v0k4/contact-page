Stop.

Consider the task you are doing.

Why are you working on it?

Why is it important?

Why?

<br />

Recently, I worked in a project that enabled users to record measurements. While prioritizing bugs, we noticed a ton of issues related to timezonesâ€”who would have guessed?!

At first, we tried the brute force approach and started moving tickets from to-do to done. But we realized soon there were just too many, so we stopped and asked why:

> Why do we need timezones?<br />
> Because we have them in the product.
>
> Why do they really matter?<br />
> Because we are recording the local time of each measurement.
>
> Why do users want timezones?<br />
> Because they might compare measurements taken across locations.
>
> Why would do they do that?<br />
> Because.. Because.. Well, that's a good question!

ELI5 worked its magic: we actually didn't need timezones. So we turned to the developers' favorite key, backspace. A few hours later and a couple of thousands of lines of code less we were done!

We made a mistake: we started with a solution (i.e. timezones). Asking why allowed us to ladder up to the problem space. Here, we uncovered an assumption (i.e. users need to compare across timezones), found a cheap way to validate it and discovered the problem was not there in the first place.
